Together with ECE120, which you should have already taken, this course gives an introduction to the design and programming of computing systems. 
This course will focus on C programming, where each new C concept will be related to the fundamental concepts described in ECE120. 
We will start by finishing our coverage of low-level concepts such as I/O, subroutines, and stacks in LC-3 assembly language, then move on to C. 
We will cover basic programming concepts, functions, arrays, pointers, I/O, recursion, simple data structures, and concepts in object-oriented programming. 
A bottom-up understanding of computing systems has proven more successful in helping students to understand advanced concepts in computing that follow in the ECE curriculum.
Again, this course requires that you take ECE120 first. 
Concurrent enrollment is not acceptable. 
If you have not met this requirement but think that you should still enroll, speak with the instructor.
